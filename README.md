# Web-Mapping

In this project I created an interactive HTML map with two different layers:
- world population distribution visible in a color range scale (yellow < 10M, orange between 10M and 20M, and red with over 20M people);
- location of Volcanoes in US territory, where at each of them a colorful pin displays its MSL.
Data sources are in txt and JSON format respectively.

On the top-right corner of the map is a layer control which allows to chose which layer has to be displayed.

### How to run the app:
- Clone git repo https://github.com/vbb08/Web-Mapping
- Python 3.8 or newer version required: Verify Python version installed with command: python --version
- Run *Map.py* file
- Open Map1.html generated file, in your browser

The project has been done following the tutorial in a Udemy course which I attended (not available anylonger):
"The Python Mega Course 2022: Build 10 Real-World Applications"

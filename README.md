# Web-Mapping

In this project I created an interactive map with two different layers:
- world population distribution visible in a color range scale (yellow < 10M, orange between 10M and 20M, and red with over 20M people);
- location of Volcanoes in US territory, where at each of them a colorful pin indicating its MSL is displayed.

On the top-right corner of the map is a layer control which allows to chose which layer has to be displayed.

The project has been done following the tutorial in a Udemy course which I attended (not available anylonger):
"The Python Mega Course 2022: Build 10 Real-World Applications"
